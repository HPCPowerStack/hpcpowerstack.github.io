## [](#header-1)Travel

Travel to Burghausen is possible via train from Munich and takes about two hours. Most itineraries require switching in the town of Muehldorf. It is recommended to arrive at Burghausen latest in time for dinner on Tuesday. Return travel to Munich after the seminar on Friday can be organized in groups during the seminar.

More information on train schedules is at <A HREF="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml">BAHN.DE</a>. Sample schedules are available through this <a href="https://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/query.exe/en?ld=38166&protocol=https:&seqnr=1&ident=h5.05068166.1526388071&rt=1&rememberSortType=minDeparture&REQ0HafasScrollDir=1">query</a>.

If you intend to continue to ISC in Frankfurt after the seminar, most likely the best connections are through Munich. Same day travel all the way to Frankfurt is possible via ICE train service from Munich, but will likely result in a late arrival time.
