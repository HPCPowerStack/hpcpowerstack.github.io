## [](#header-1)Travel

Travel to Burghausen is possible via train from Munich and takes about two hours. Most itineraries require switching in the town of Muehldorf. It is recommended to arrive at Burghausen latest in time for dinner on Tuesday. Return travel to Munich after the seminar on Friday can be organized in groups during the seminar.

More information on train schedules is at <A HREF="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml">BAHN.DE</a>. Trains leave Munich Main Trainstation (HBF) almost hourly (final destination Mühldorf or Simbach (Inn) - you will need to change in Mühldorf for the train to Burghausen.

In Burghausen it is a short 15min (1.1km) walk from the trains station to the hotel (see <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Burghausen,+84489+Burghausen,+Germany/Hotel+Glocklhofer,+Ludwigsberg,+Burghausen,+Germany/@48.1702459,12.8246652,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x4775ce1100e5fb73:0x6fb0e475107651f8!2m2!1d12.8284694!2d48.1738909!1m5!1m1!1s0x4775ce0473780e8d:0xeaa559646209eaee!2m2!1d12.8324229!2d48.166132!3e2">map</a>).

Alternatively, arrival by car is possible as well. There is free uncovered parking at the hotel and a free garage in the city square close by. Also, the hotel offers paid parking in the hotel garage (6,50 Euro per day).

If you intend to continue to ISC in Frankfurt after the seminar by publict transort, most likely the best connections are through Munich. Same day travel all the way to Frankfurt is possible via ICE train service from Munich, but will likely result in a late arrival time.
