<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>Save-the-Date</b><br/>June 2020 in Raitenhaslach, Germany</font></p>

The Raitenhaslach Seminar on "The HPC PowerStack: Enabling Efficient Power
Management in High-Performance Computing through Hierarchical Design" will be
held in June 2020 in Raitenhaslach, Germany. It will bring together experts
from academia, research laboratories and industry in order to design and
engineer a holistic and extensible, deployable power management framework.
Such a framework could ultimately lead to standardization or - at least -
homogenization efforts for this important piece of the HPC software stack.

The seminar will be held at the <a
href="https://www.raitenhaslach.tum.de/en/home/">Science and Study Center</a>
of the <a href="https://www.tum.de/nc/en/homepage/">Technical University of
Munich (TUM)</a>.  Nestled in the beautiful Bavarian landscape flanking the
river Salzach, the former Cistercian monastery Raitenhaslach exudes inspiration
and historical charm. After extensive restoration work, the monastery's
late-baroque prelate's wing has been developed into a hub of international
academic discussion. The nearby <a href="https://www.burghausen.de/">town of
Burghausen</a> provided an ideal setting for evening discussions. The city is
situated along the river Salzach and is home of the <a
href="http://www.burg-burghausen.de/englisch/castle/bedeut.htm">worlds longest
castle</a>, which sits on a ridge line above the city.

If you are interested in attending, please let one of the organizers know.
Registration and more information to come next year.
