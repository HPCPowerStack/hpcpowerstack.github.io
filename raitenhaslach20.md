<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>THIS WILL BE A VIRTUAL MEETING IN JUNE 2020</b></font></p><br/>
Due to recent COVID-19 challenges, the PowerStack committee plans on organizing
its annual mid-year seminar as a digital event instead of face-to-face. This
structure has the additional benefit of including participants who have been
unable to attend prior events due to travel restrictions. Like past years, we
will schedule this event during the week prior to the ISC conference (which is
also going digital).

The PowerStack seminar will be June 17th (Wed) through
June 19th (Fri) with the exact time to be decided soon (we plan on 3 hour blocks on each day). 
We are quite hopeful that this will lead to more focused discussions.  The goal is provide updates from the working groups that had formed at the last seminar in November and to discuss the resulting documents and their next steps. Attendance will be free of charge and a registration site will be available soon. 

Please feel free to forward the news of our digital seminar to other
colleagues, as needed.

Sincerely,<br/>
The HPC PowerStack core-committee

<h1 align="center">PowerStack Seminar</h1>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">June 17-19, 2020 (Wed-Fri)<br/>Virtual Event</font></p>

The seminar on "The HPC PowerStack: Enabling Efficient Power Management in
High-Performance Computing through Hierarchical Design" will be held digitially
in June 2020. It will bring together experts from academia, research
laboratories and industry in order to design and engineer a holistic and
extensible, deployable power management framework.  Such a framework could
ultimately lead to standardization or - at least - homogenization efforts for
this important piece of the HPC software stack.

If you are interested in attending, please let one of the organizers know.
