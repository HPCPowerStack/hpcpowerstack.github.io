<h1 align="center">The HPC PowerStack: A Community-Driven Collaboration Toward a Software Stack for Power and Energy Efficiency</h1>

## Description
While there exist several standalone efforts that attempt to tackle exascale
power and energy challenges, the majority of the implemented techniques have
been designed to meet site-specific needs. There is no consensus among the
stakeholders in academia, research and industry on which software components of
modern HPC stack should be deployed and how they should interoperate.
Coordination among these components is critical towards maximizing a target
metric (such as FLOPS per watt) while meeting operating constraints (such as
energy).

This realization led to the formation of the (PowerStack
Community)[https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1466153/] in 2016. Its charter is to
identify what power optimization software actors are needed, how they
interoperate to streamline the optimization goals, and how to glue together
existing open source production software for a cost-effective yet cohesive,
cross-platform implementation of the software stack.

This interactive vendor-neutral BoF will provide a platform to bring together
the stakeholders from academia, research and industry to participate in this
consortium and work towards fine-tuning the stack. The vision of this BoF is to
share lessons learned through prototyping efforts, provide progress updates,
invite audience feedback on current directions, brainstorm solutions to open
questions, and issue a call-for-collaboration.
