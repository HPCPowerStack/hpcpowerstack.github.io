<p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>THIS WILL BE AN IN-PERSON MEETING IN NOVEMBER 2022</b></font></p><br/>
The PowerStack committee plans on organizing its annual seminar as a in-person. This structure has the additional benefit of including participants who have been unable to attend prior events due to travel restrictions. Like past years, we will schedule this event during the week prior to the SC conference (which will be located at Dallas).

The PowerStack seminar will be a two-day event on November 10th (Thurs) and November 11th (Fri), from 8am to 5pm (Central US Time - CDT). 
We are quite hopeful that this will lead to more focused discussions.  The goal is provide updates from the working groups that had formed at the last seminar in November and to discuss the resulting documents and their next steps. Attendance will be free of charge. Registration link below 

Please feel free to reach out to the organizers if you'd like to invite additional participants.

Sincerely,<br/>
The HPC PowerStack core-committee

<h1 align="center">PowerStack Seminar</h1>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">November 10-11, 2022 (Thurs-Fri)<br/>In-person Event</font></p>

The seminar on "The HPC PowerStack: Enabling Efficient Power Management in
High-Performance Computing through Hierarchical Design" will be held digitially
in June 2020. It will bring together experts from academia, research
laboratories and industry in order to design and engineer a holistic and
extensible, deployable power management framework.  Such a framework could
ultimately lead to standardization or - at least - homogenization efforts for
this important piece of the HPC software stack.

This is a closed meeting and seating is limited! If you are interested in attending, please reach out to one of the organizers know.

## Agenda (Tentative)

### Novemeber 10th, 2022 (Thursday)

- Community announcements: (30mins)
	- REGALE updates (TUM/LRZ) 
	- revisit topics/project presented in HiPEAC
	- workshop paper on malleability (dyn. job size change) in powerstack
	- HPE interest in GEOPM
 
- Community engagements (45 mins)
	- Use cases & policies of powerstack
		- REGALE directions
			- Energy costs rising, opportunities for powerstack (Fugaku)
			- Tradeoff between facility vs system level policies
	 
- Working topics / breakout sessions: (2 hrs) 
	- internal sync + 30mins lessons learned (90 mins)
	- compare past powerstack w/ latest trends
	- missing gaps in the design of an integrated stack (invite Michael Ott)
	- challenges faced by sites affecting the adoption of the stack



### Novemeber 11th, 2022 (Friday)
 
- SW project updates (30mins)
	- flux, LDMS, variorum - view from El Capitan
	- GEOPM integration into the stack - systemd service
	- REGALE prototypes
	- updates from system integrator solutions (e.g., HPE's HPCM)
 
- Technical topics: (2 hrs )
	- 90mins internal sync + 30mins lessons learned
	- co-scheduling (unpublished work by REGALE team on perf. modeling)
	- malleability (PBS features)
	- co-Tuning (Argonne)
	- workflow mgmt (power profiling of multiple workflows & binaries), also of interest for one of the REGALE prototypes design
	- Integrating monitoring frameworks (like LDMS, DCDB) 
	- resource mgrs (JSRM) & system level runtime systems for dynamic power mgmt 
	- upcoming exascale system discussions - power mgmt stack design -- new design, redundant components
 
- Community input & future direction: (30mins) <-- needs more time
	- what are the new SW components in the stack?
	- charter of PowerStack
	- reach a consensus on the different components needed within the PS
	- reach a consensus on scope of PS, validation efforts
	- where do we go from here
	- virtual annual event, or more hands-on f2f?
	- REGALE future plans
 
- Whitepaper
	- Status: current status of existing projects & software stack; interface between the layers
	- identify gaps 
	- update old osti.gov paper
	- include lessons learned from REGALE project (3 examples)
	- changes in the stack by system integrators
