<h1 align="center">The First Annual Workshop for HPC PowerStack</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Community-Driven Effort to Enable System-wide Power Efficiency</h3>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">Thursday, June 20, 2019<br>
9AM -- 6PM<br>
Frankfurt Marriott Hotel, Room Gold 2<br></font></p>

## Motivation
Although there exist several standalone efforts that attempt to tackle exascale
power challenges, the majority of the state-of-the-art implemented techniques
have been designed to meet site-specific needs or optimization goals. Community
specifications such as the PowerAPI and Redfish provide high-level power
management interfaces for accessing power knobs. However, these stop short of
defining which software components should actually be involved, and how should
they interoperate with each other in a cohesive and coordinated stack. We
believe coordination among these components is critical for avoiding
underutilization of system Watts and FLOPS.

The above realization led to the formation of the HPC PowerStack Community in 2016. The charter of this community has been to:
* Identify the key software actors needed in a system power stack:
job-schedulers, application-level runtime, hardware knobs;
* Identify their respective privileges, roles, and responsibilities;
* Design communication protocols for bidirectional control and feedback
signals among them to enable scalable coordination at different
granularities;
* Design mechanisms for actors to access privileged hardware controls and
monitors to ensure stable closed-loop optimization;
* Study and combine existing ad-hoc engineering and development prototypes
and build a community that actively participates in well-engineered, scalable
and deployable solutions.

This workshop will disseminate key insights that have been acquired so far
within this community, provide status updates on the first prototype, invite
audience feedback on current directions, and brainstorm solutions to open
questions. We will also issue a call-to-action to join the collaboration to
build an even stronger community.
