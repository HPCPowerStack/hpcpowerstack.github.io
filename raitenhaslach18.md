The Raitenhaslach Seminar on "The HPC PowerStack: Enabling Efficient Power Management in High-Performance Computing through Hierarchical Design" was held from June 20-22, 2018 in Raitenhaslach, Germany. A first-of-its kind seminar, it brought together experts from academia, research laboratories and industry in order to design and engineer a holistic and extensible, deployable power management framework. Such a framework could ultimately lead to standardization or - at least - homogenization efforts for this important piece of the HPC software stack. An initial strawman document was created for this seminar.


The backdrop for this seminar was the new <a href="https://www.raitenhaslach.tum.de/en/home/">Science and Study Center</a> of the <a href="https://www.tum.de/nc/en/homepage/">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a>.
Nestled in the beautiful Bavarian landscape flanking the river Salzach, the former Cistercian monastery Raitenhaslach exudes inspiration and historical charm. After extensive restoration work, the monastery's late-baroque prelate's wing has been developed into a hub of international academic discussion. The nearby <a href="https://www.burghausen.de/">town of Burghausen</a> provided an ideal setting for evening discussions. The city is situated along the river Salzach and is home of the <a href="http://www.burg-burghausen.de/englisch/castle/bedeut.htm">worlds longest castle</a>, which sits on a ridge line above the city.
