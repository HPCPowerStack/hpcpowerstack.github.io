## Description
Power and energy are critical Exascale constraints. Achieving system efficiency
is a challenge under such constraints due to dynamic application phase
behavior, increasing variation in processor power efficiency resulting from
manufacturing, and due to complexities arising from upcoming heterogeneous
architectures. In order to address some of these challenges, Intel introduced
GEOPM, an open-source, portable, hierarchical job-level runtime system to
optimize for time-to-solution by leveraging techniques from learning and
control systems. Other processor architectures like IBM POWER and ARM have
recognized the value of GEOPM, and are currently working to add their specific
processor support. In this hands-on, half-day tutorial, we will discuss the
state-of-the-art power management techniques used by Intel, IBM, and ARM, and
discuss GEOPM features and usability. A high-level overview of the GEOPM
architecture, a walkthrough of the GEOPM plugin infrastructure, and use cases
will be discussed. Third-party plugins developed as part of Exascale Computing
Projectâ€™s GEOPM plugins will also be demonstrated. Algorithms used to speed up
application critical path (through adaptive configuration selection) and
mitigate process variation (through intelligent power management) will be
discussed. State-of-the-art and best practices for leveraging power management
techniques in modern processors will also be covered.
